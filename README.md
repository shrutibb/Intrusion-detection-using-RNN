# Intrusion-detection-using-RNN
This Project involves the application of advanced machine learning techniques to  enhance the security of computer systems. In this study, RNNs are employed to analyze  sequential data patterns in network traffic, allowing for the detection of anomalous  behavior indicative of potential intrusions.
